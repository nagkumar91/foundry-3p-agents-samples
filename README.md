# Foundry Third-Party Agents Samples

Tiny examples that show how to plug Azure Application Insights into popular agent stacks.

## Folders

- `aws/agent_core/` – LangGraph + AgentCore sample for Amazon Bedrock.
- `gcp/vertax/` – LangChain agent running on Google Vertex AI.
- `gcp/a2a/remote_agent/` – LangGraph currency agent with local runner, evaluator, and Cloud Run deployment script.

Each folder has its own README with setup steps, required environment variables, and deployment notes. Pick the sample you care about, install the listed requirements, follow the per-folder README, and you’ll see traces land in Application Insights.
